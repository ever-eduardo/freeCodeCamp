                <h3>The story of a brilliant man</h3>
                <p>Alan Turing is considered the father of computer science and artificial intelligence.
                    He prooved that there is no algorithm that can answer some decision problems.
                    To answer that, he invented a mathematical device that he called the Automatic Machine, 
                    and showed that the famous Halting problem cannot be solved by a computer.
                    The Automatic Machine is known now as the Turing Machine.
                </p>
                <p>During the WWII, Turing worked at Bletchley Park, the British codebraker center that produced ultra intelligence,
                    and he contributed to descipher the Enigma Machine.
                    The encoded messages sent from the German HQ were known by the British and their allies.</p>
                <p>The saddest part of Turing's life was the prosecution he faced for homosexual acts.
                    He was forced to choose between prision or a hormone treatment. 
                    He chose the later. However, in the history of humanity there will be a record of intolerance and misunderstading
                    towards this brilliant mathematician. According to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alan_Turing" target="_blank">Wikipedia</a>, Turing was postumed pardoned for such crimes, and the law to gave similar pardon to
                    all men that were prosecuted by the same acts, is known as the Turing law. He died from cyanide poisoning, and stil remains
                    open the case of suicide and accidental poisoning. 
                </p>
                <h3>The Turing Machine</h3>
                <p>
                    In 1928 David Hilbert stated a challenge called the decision problem. The problem asks for an algorithm that considers as input
                    a mathematical statement, and answers yes or no according to whether the statement is universally valid or not.
                    Turing worked on the problem, and his answer was no. To put it simple: a machine cannot do mathematics. Mathematics seems to be something
                    more than just machanical, syntactic symbol manipulation. However, a machine can do lots of calculations faster than a human could do it.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Today we enjoy all the advantages that come from computers, and perhaps the humanity will not be the same as before Turing.
